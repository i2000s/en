To setup a secured github page, I have basically followed [this steps](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/) with the free service from CloudFlare.
On step 3 of the instruction linked, I have used a more general setting to redirect naked (no www) DNS to the full path based on the trick pointed out by [CloudFlare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172286-How-do-I-perform-URL-forwarding-or-redirects-with-CloudFlare-).
The `redirect.html` layout file should have set up the correct 301 permanent redirect to ensure all pages to use `https` protocols in my case, but if your website is hosted on a repo other than your username/organization's github pages repo, you may need to double check if the URL is correct or not in the layout file.

Redirect URLs:
=============
I used a 301 redirect technique [illustrated on the CSS-trick website](https://css-tricks.com/redirect-web-page/) with javascript and HTML meta script on the old link location.
You can find my template on the [main website](https://github.com/i2000s/i2000s.github.io.git)/`_post` folder.
You may also be able to use the `redirects.rb` plugin as illustrated on [this page](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/19/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll.html).
Or, you can use the `Jekyll-redirect-from` [plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) to forward a previous link to the current URL.
The other option is to simply add the original URL to the *permalinks*: item in the YAML header for each post, and then Jekyll would use that URL instead of the automatically generated permalink structure.
Some of the benefits of sticking to permanent links and more details on keeping links updated using this template can be found on [Carl Boettiger's labnotebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/05/31/notebook-features-digital-archiving.html).
Notice that permalink can only provide a relative link to the current repo file structure and is hard to redirect to a higher level URL from the new repo.
For the same reason, when a page is cloned to a subrepo from the head repo, the permalink of the page--if defined in YAML--shouldn't be changed yet will be automatically put in the new folder of the virtual whole website.

Permanent link registration:
===========================
To prevent some trouble caused by lose/change of domain name, I am using a PURL, or permanent universal resource link, to associate with my current domain name.
I registered a user ID on [purl.org](http://purl.org) and then created a domain name `/qxd` for my site.
In the domain name setting of `/qxd`, I selected `partial` or partial redirection as the type of PURL and put the `https://qixiaodong.com` as the target address.
This way, if my site's domain name got changed, I can just update the PURL for the site for people to find my new website.
Notice that, the partial redirection function will ensure every page under the registered domain name can be visited using the `purl.org/qxd` domain name plus the subdomain or page address related to the site address.
If you use the `301` or `302` or other types, your registered domain name cannot recognize the association of subdomain names on your website.

Centralize information from sub-repos:
======================================
Once the website is branched out with separated repos (sub-repos, in our case), it would be nice to collect some key information on the front page.
Some ideas of collecting/redirecting tags and categories of posts have been outlined in [Carl Boetigger's labnotebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html).
The only difference in my case is that I am using sub-repos for pages in different languages and for different projects rather than for posts archived in every year.
