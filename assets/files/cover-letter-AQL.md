# Selected main accomplishments
I am briefly highlighting a few items that I have been working on or completed in the past a few years.
Details may be found in my CV submitted with this application, or my detailed research statement which be found at https://www.qixiaodong.tk/en/assets/files/research-statement.html.

1. Developed a set of theories and computational algorithms to study the quantum interface with nanophotonic cavities and quantum dots.
This includes the derivation of N-body Green's function tensors based Dyson equations and master equations of exciton-light interactions, the derivation of the luminescence spectrum due to collective emissions of quantum dots and the study on the law of spectrum broadening in both strong and weak coupling regimes.

2. Developed the dispersive atom-light interaction theory to study the atom-nanophotonic waveguide quantum interface with applications to quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement, spin squeezing, state preparations and cooling of atoms trapped nearby the nanophotonic waveguides.
We proposed and have been working numerous protocols for implementing those applications.
This quantum interface is a promising platform to implementing quantum simulations and quantum information processing algorithms once the full control ability is achieved in the lab.
Our study provided some new insights on enhancing the atom-light coupling. For example, we show that on the waveguide platform, one don't need to place the atoms at the strongest local field position to achieve the strong atom-light coupling; in fact, the strongest coupling position to place atoms is actually on the weakest local field spots for the quantum measurement and spin squeezing protocols we studies. We explain this by defining the cooperativity for our protocols.

3. Cofounded the JuliaQuantum (https://JuliaQuantum.github.io) open-source organization working on building programming libraries in Julia for simulating quantum systems on a classical computer or quantum control tasks on future quantum devices and to formed a big network of collaborations across disciplines.
Particularly, I have been working on the theory towards resource-efficient computing approaches including symbolic computations based on representation theories, computing without calculating everything based on symmetry, using the tensor network representation or truncated N-body moments (like N-design approach) approaches to represent quantum states and operators, as well as using quantum devices as an oracle to solve quantum control and optimization problems (for example, the self-guided tomography method to obtain the fidelity parameter directly from the quantum state annihilations on a copy of the quantum device).
The ideas and program prototypes could be useful for simulating quantum systems on a classical computer and controlling quantum devices.

4. Studied nano- and micro-device design and physics, and developed theories for designing THz-radiation sources and a new type of semiconductor lasers.


I am interested in applying for the Research Engineer if qualified or a PostDoc position in the Alibaba Quantum Labs.
I am considering the Research Engineer position as my top choice mainly because I think the community now need more engineers than scientists that we have before to start the industry of building quantum computing elements and devices.
I would be happy to conduct theoretical and practical researches focusing either on some particular quantum hardware--particularly based on atom-light interaction theories--or the software and device-independent aspect of quantum simulations and quantum computing tasks.

As my graduation will happen before the end of April next year.
I can start my job in May 2018.
I don't have any restrictions on the locations I am going to work at in the foreseeable near-term future if I get the offer from AQL.

You can find my work samples online from the publication list of CV.
Here I can highlight a few of them:
1. Xiaodong Qi, Ben Q. Baragiola, Poul S. Jessen, and Ivan H. Deutsch. Dispersive response of atoms trapped near the surface of an optical nanofiber with applications to quantum nondemolition measurement and spin squeezing, Phys. Rev. A 93, 023817 (2016)
2. Dehua Li, Xiaodong Qi and Shenggang Liu. A theoretical analysis of optical-to-THz conversion efficiency via optical rectification. Science in China series E, 51(12), 2008, 2080-2088.

Notice that I do want to share my next paper draft on the project of "Enhanced cooperativity for quantum nondemolition measurement-induced spin squeezing of atoms coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide" (a related poster can be found on the Sandia website at https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1373174).
However, since this work is fully funded by the Sandia National Lab and the Sandia Review & Approval process hasn't been finished 20 days after my submission, I have to ask your pardon at this moment and will update to you once the approval letter reaches me.
