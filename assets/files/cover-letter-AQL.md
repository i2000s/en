# Selected main accomplishments
I am briefly highlighting a few items that I have completed or have been working on in the past a few years.
Details may be found in my CV submitted with this application, or my detailed research statement which can be viewed at https://www.qixiaodong.tk/en/assets/files/research-statement.html.

1. Developed the dispersive atom-light interaction theory to study the quantum interface of atom-nanophotonic waveguides. We proposed and have been working on protocols for quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement, spin squeezing, state preparation and cooling of atoms trapped into an optical lattice nearby the nanophotonic waveguides.
This quantum interface is a promising platform to implementing quantum simulations and quantum information processing algorithms, in which case we believe the full controllability can be achieved with guided and unguided light over the waveguide.
Our study discovered some new phenomena and tricks in enhancing the atom-light coupling. For example, our simulations show that one doesn't need to place the atoms at the strongest local field positions to achieve strong atom-light coupling using the waveguide interface; in fact, the strongest coupling position to place atoms is actually on the weakest local field spots for the quantum measurement and spin squeezing protocols we studied. We explained this by defining the cooperativity for our protocols.

2. Developed theories and computational algorithms to study the quantum interface with nanophotonic cavities and quantum dots.
This includes the derivation of N-body Green's function tensors based Dyson equations and master equations of exciton-light interactions, the derivation of the luminescence spectrum due to collective emissions of quantum dots and the study on the law of spectrum broadening in both strong and weak coupling regimes.

3. Cofounded the JuliaQuantum (https://JuliaQuantum.github.io) open-source organization to build programming libraries in Julia for simulating quantum systems on classical computers and for implementing quantum control algorithms on future quantum devices.
Particularly, I have been working on the theory towards resource-efficient computing approaches including symbolic computations based on representation theories, computing without calculating everything based on symmetry, using the tensor network representation or truncated N-body moments approaches to represent quantum states and operators, as well as using quantum devices as an oracle to solve quantum control and optimization problems.
We have also formed a big network of collaborations across disciplines.

4. Studied nano- and micro-device design and physics, and developed theories for designing THz-radiation sources and proposed a new type of semiconductor lasers.

# Positions I am applying for
I am interested in applying for the Research Engineer if qualified or a PostDoc position in the Alibaba Quantum Labs.
I am considering the Research Engineer position as my top choice mainly because I think the community now need more engineers than scientists that we have before to start the industry of building quantum computing elements and devices.
I would be happy to conduct theoretical and practical researches focusing either on some particular quantum hardware--particularly based on atom-light interaction theories--or the software and device-independent aspect of quantum simulations and quantum computing tasks.
I could also work as a Research Scientist if the job review committee think that is a better fit for me.

# Expected starting date and place restrictions
As my graduation will happen before the end of April next year.
I can start my job in May 2018.
I don't have any restrictions on the locations I am going to work at in the foreseeable near-term future if I get the offer from AQL.

# Work samples
You can find my work samples online from the publication list of CV.
Here I can highlight a few of them:

2. Xiaodong Qi, Yuan-Yu Jau, and Ivan H. Deutsch. Enhanced cooperativity for quantum nondemolition measurement-induced spin squeezing of atoms coupled to a nanophotonic waveguide (to be submitted)
3. Xiaodong Qi. Modeling and deciphering on two spin-polariton entanglement experiments on NV centers of diamond. arXiv:1111.5532 [physics.gen-ph].
4. Xiaodong Qi. Put everything on a quantum circuit--part I (quantum dynamics revisited), A tutorial to mentored students for Google Summer of Code projects by JuliaQuantum, https://purl.org/qxd/en/2016/07/23/put-everything-on-a-quantum-circuit-part-i.html

Notice that I do want to share my next paper manuscript which is the second work sample (the related poster can be found on the Sandia website at https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/1373174).
However, since this work is fully funded by the Sandia National Lab and the Sandia Review & Approval process hasn't been finished 20 days after my submission, I have to ask your pardon at this moment and will update to you once the approval letter arrives.

Thank you for your attention! Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
