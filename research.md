## Current projects

My research involves theoretical studies on the strong coupling between atoms and photons on an optical nanofiber (see figure below) and other nanophotonic platforms, especially to study the fundamental limits and possibilities of state preparation, control and readout (measurement) operations on an ensemble of atoms using waveguide interfaces as a data bus towards quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum sensing applications.
This study was initially motivated as an upgrade to the free space atom-light quantum interface platforms implemented in cold atom labs towards a stronger coupling between atoms and light.
My Research Statement for the purpose of some job applications can be found [here](/en/assets/files/research-statement.html).

As shown in the figure above, to enhance the coupling strength between an atomic ensemble and light propagated in free space as a Gaussian laser beam, one can either focus the laser beam very tightly so that the few atoms at the beam waist could couple to the optical field strongly (as shown in subfigure (a)), or by using a less focused laser beam so that more atoms can be coupled to the light (as shown in (b)).
Obviously, the former approach doesn't allow a large number of atoms couple to the light as strongly as the ones at the beam waist; and the latter approach makes the light-atom coupling weak per atom.
Either way, the effective atom number that can be strongly coupled to the light is always far less than the total number of atoms trapped in the free-space atom-light interface, and the effective light signal collected in the quantum measurement process is far less than the input due to the poor mode matching nature of the free-space quantum interface caused by strong incoherent light scattering from atoms.
In contrast, if the atoms are trapped around an optical nanofiber using the fiber's evanescent field as shown in subfigure (c), not only all atoms could be all evenly and strongly coupled to the light, but also the forwarding light signal can be efficiently collected due to good mode matching.
In the end, compared to the free-space case, far less number of atoms are needed using the nanofiber platform to generate a considerable amount of light-atomic ensemble coupling strength, which could open up possibilities, for example, to generate non-Gaussian collective spin states using quantum measurement.

We have outlined and proposed in our recent theory paper ([Phys. Rev. A 93, 023817(2016)](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.023817)) that, in the dispersive regime, this nanofiber system can generate a strong coupling with the alkali metal atom ensembles, which can be used for precise quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of atomic clocks as a Ramsey interferometer as well as for spin squeezing beyond the Gaussian state limit with fewer atoms than the free-space case.
All of these findings imply a promising future for the nanofiber platform for atomic clocks, precise measurements, quantum data bus and other quantum information processing applications.
During the study, our group has been closely working with our experimental collaborators, and the future of our project is tightly orientated by the new findings and inevitable challenges that our experimental collaborators have concluded and based on our theoretical insights which can make a fundamental difference for the frontier research of quantum information and quantum computing community.
My current on-going theory research projects include the following and are open for new directions:

 - Optimal QND measurement protocols on the nanofiber trapped atomic systems.
 - Optical pumping on the nanofiber platform for atomic state preparation.
 - Atomic cooling protocols on the trapped atomic ensemble on nanofiber.
 - Other nanophotonic waveguides towards even better atom-light interface based on our new understanding of measurement-based atom-light coupling.
 - Optical lattices in the strong coupling regime.

In addition, through establishing the theoretical foundation of light-atom interaction on the nanofiber platform, I hope to reach the regime of nonlinear interaction between photons for quantum simulations/computations/communications,
and to deeply understand the quantum behaviors of atoms and photons and the role of nanophotonic geometries for better integratable photonic systems for quantum information processing.  
Stay tuned!
